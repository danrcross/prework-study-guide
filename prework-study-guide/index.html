        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In short, Git is a version control system.</li>
          <li>This allows users and teams to work together on projects, keeping track of the versions of and changes made to an application.</li>
          <li>Tip: make sure to commit your work frequently</li>
          <li>Tip: make sure you are working on the correct branch</li>
          <li>Create a "pull request" to attempt to merge a branch you have worked on to the main repository (repo).</li>
          <li>The basic workflow of GitHub is as follows: make changes on new branch, pull request (content reviewed), merge branches and deploy.</li>
          <li>(You may at some point look into the application "Federalist" as part of your workflow)</li>
          <li>A Git command always begins with "git"</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
