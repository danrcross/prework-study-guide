## Description

This is a prework study guide website: a website that was formed using newly learned skills, as well as a website that contains information about those newly learned skills!

- This was made because I wanted to solidify my newly acquired knowledge through the procedural practice of those skills, as well as the repetition of rote information.
- This site will be a resource for myself, to revisit basic information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It will be a showcase of my skills as a developer in my nascent phase.
- I learned how to write an HTML site, create a CSS stylesheet, link that stylesheet, create for loops and conditional statements with JavaScript, use JavaScript in the DevTools console in Google Chrome, create and clone Git repositories, and create new Git branches to push and merge with the main branch using a pull request from GitHub.

## Installation

No installation required. Visit URL to see website.

## Usage

Use of this study guide is simple. Read and study the bullet points in each section of the webpage. As the subheading of the site suggests, you might open the console using the shortcut "cmd+opt+I." Here, you will find a suggestion of what to study first. See screenshot below.
