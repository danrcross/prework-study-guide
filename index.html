        <h2>HTML</h2>
         <ul>
           <li>HTML stands for "hypertext markup language"</li>
           <li>HTML defines the structure of a webpage</li>
           <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
           <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
           <li>"Child elements" are enclosed by "parent elements"</li>
           <li>An "element" is the whole statement of information that is contained by an opening and closing "tag," a direction enclosed in angle brackets.</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>CSS defines the style (colors, fonts, etc.) of a webpage.</li>
            <li>You can use CSS language within an HTML file in two ways: using inline commands or an internal style sheet.</li>
            <li>Inline commands are included in the initial tag of the element you would like to style.</li>
            <li>An internal style sheet is contained within the head of the HTML file, using the "style" tag.</li>
            <li>Most commonly, however, an external style sheet is used.</li>
            <li>An external style sheet (a .css file) can be linked to an HTML file by adding a "link" tag in the head.</li>
            <li>By using a single common "class selector," a designated style can be applied to multiple elements within your HTML file.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In short, Git is a version control system.</li>
          <li>This allows users and teams to work together on projects, keeping track of the versions of and changes made to an application.</li>
          <li>Tip: make sure to commit your work frequently</li>
          <li>Tip: make sure you are working on the correct branch</li>
          <li>Create a "pull request" to attempt to merge a branch you have worked on to the main repository (repo).</li>
          <li>The basic workflow of GitHub is as follows: make changes on new branch, pull request (content reviewed), merge branches and deploy.</li>
          <li>(You may at some point look into the application "Federalist" as part of your workflow)</li>
          <li>A Git command always begins with "git"</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> JavaScript allows interactivity with a webpage: effects, data communication, etc.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes JS code. JS is read from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop repeats a certain command until directed to stop.</li>
          <li>Data types: string (text), number, Boolean (t/f), array, object (general).</li>
          <li>A comment can be started with '/*' and ended with '*/'.</li>
          <li>Conditional statement: tests if an expression returns true or not, exectues based on truth value.</li>
          <li>Function: often followed by '()'. Needs to be called in order to work.</li>
